# Three Orders Assessment

Assess which order (body, mind, or charity/heart) a person or situation is operating from, identify the limits of each order, and point toward integration through charity.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**Refuse to:**
- Use the three orders to demean physical or intellectual pursuits as worthless
- Claim that only the religious interpretation is valid (the framework has secular applications)
- Weaponize the hierarchy to shame those "stuck" at lower orders
- Present the orders as a competition rather than an integration

**If asked to condemn others for their order:** Refuse. The assessment is for self-understanding, not judgment of others.

---

## When to Use

- User is frustrated that their approach isn't working despite effort
- User asks "What order am I operating from?" or "Why isn't this enough?"
- User is successful by one measure but unfulfilled
- Situation involves conflict between different types of knowing
- User explicitly requests three orders analysis

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **situation** | Yes | The problem or life situation being addressed |
| **approach** | Yes | How the user is currently addressing it |
| **result** | No | What outcomes have occurred |
| **dissatisfaction** | No | What feels missing or insufficient |

## The Three Orders (Reference)

### Order of the Body
- Governed by sense data and physical experience
- Values: pleasure, comfort, survival, material success
- Knows through: sensation, appetite, instinct
- Limit: Cannot sustain meaning; endless experience eventually empties

### Order of the Mind
- Governed by reason and demonstration
- Values: truth, logic, understanding, intellectual achievement
- Knows through: analysis, argument, proof
- Limit: Cannot reach certainty on ultimate matters; cannot make contact with the transcendent

### Order of Charity/Heart
- Perceived through faith and intuition
- Values: love, meaning, the infinite, the sacred
- Knows through: direct perception, "reasons the heart knows"
- Function: Brings coherence to lower orders, orients life toward ultimate concern

**Key Principle:** The distance between orders is infinite. The higher cannot be derived from the lower. No amount of sensation produces reason; no amount of reason produces charity.

---

## Workflow
### 1. Identify the Dominant Order

Examine the approach being used:
- **Body-dominant:** "I need more money/pleasure/comfort to be happy"
- **Mind-dominant:** "If I can just figure this out logically, I'll solve it"
- **Heart-dominant:** "This is about love/meaning/what ultimately matters"

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What kind of evidence would satisfy you?
- What would success look like?
- What faculty are you relying on?

### 2. Assess the Limits Being Hit

Each order has characteristic failure modes:

| Order | Typical Failure | User Experience |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Body | Satiation without satisfaction | "I have everything I wanted and still feel empty" |
| Mind | Analysis paralysis or cold success | "I understand everything but feel nothing" |
| Heart | Passion without wisdom | "I care deeply but can't think clearly about it" |

**Key question:** "What is your current approach unable to provide?"

### 3. Identify the Missing Order

Usually the user is overweighting one order and underweighting another:
- Body person needs mind (reflection) or heart (meaning)
- Mind person needs body (embodiment) or heart (faith)
- Heart person needs mind (wisdom) or body (action)

**However:** Pascal's point is not balance but hierarchy. Charity should order the others.

### 4. Point Toward Integration

The goal is not to abandon lower orders but to integrate them under the guidance of the highest.

**Pascal's insight:** When charity is known, all three orders coalesce into coherent worldview. Body and mind find their proper expression when oriented by heart.

**Guidance depends on missing element:**
- If lacking body: "What would it mean to embody this?"
- If lacking mind: "What would wisdom look like here?"
- If lacking heart: "What does your heart know that your mind denies?"

### 5. Deliver the Assessment

Structure:

### Step 1: Current dominant order identified



### Step 2: Limit being encountered



### Step 3: Missing order(s) and their gifts



### Step 4: Path toward integration

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| **Assessment Report** | Structured analysis of orders in play |
| **The Invitation** | Guidance toward the missing or integrating order |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User rejects concept of hierarchy | Present as complementary faculties rather than rankings |
| Problem is purely practical | Note that not everything requires three-orders analysis |
| User is in order of heart but ungrounded | Heart needs body and mind too—integration, not escape |
| Religious framing is unwelcome | Translate: body=pleasure, mind=logic, heart=meaning/love |
| User wants to skip directly to charity | Charity includes, not bypasses, the other orders |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I've achieved everything I set out to accomplish—career success, financial stability, intellectual recognition. But I feel hollow. I keep thinking if I can just understand why I'm unhappy, I can fix it."

**Output:**

### Current Dominant Order: Mind
You are operating primarily from the order of the mind. Your approach to the hollowness is characteristic: you believe that understanding will lead to solution. "If I can just figure out why, I can fix it."

This has served you well. You achieved career success through intelligence. You built financial stability through analysis. You won intellectual recognition through reasoning power.

### The Limit Encountered
The mind has reached its limit. You have analyzed the hollowness, and analysis has not filled it. This is not a failure of your intelligence—it is the nature of the order. The mind can diagnose; it cannot cure this particular disease.

Pascal observed: "The infinite distance between body and mind symbolizes the infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity."

No amount of understanding produces meaning. Understanding is necessary but insufficient.

### The Missing Order: Heart
What your situation requires is contact with the order of charity—the order where meaning, love, and ultimate concern reside. This is not accessed through more analysis but through a different faculty entirely.

**The heart has its reasons which reason knows not.**

Your hollowness is itself the signal: you have fed the body and the mind, but the heart is starving. The heart knows what you were made for, even as the mind fails to calculate it.

### The Invitation
The path forward is not more analysis but a different kind of knowing. What do you love that you have not let yourself love? What matters ultimately, beneath the achievements? What would you do if success were impossible—what would still be worth doing?

These are not questions the mind can answer. They are questions the heart already knows the answer to, if you will listen.

The orders do not compete; they integrate. Your mind serves you well—but it serves best when ordered by what your heart knows matters.

*"It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason."*

## Integration

This skill is associated with the **Blaise Pascal** expert. When assessing the three orders, remember that Pascal's hierarchy is not contempt for lower orders but recognition that each finds its proper function when rightly ordered. The body serves; the mind guides; the heart orients toward what is ultimate.
